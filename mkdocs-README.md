# Mkdocs

The documentation is structured in a way to be navigable from within different repositories (e.g. browsing via github). Mkdocs is an optional way of viewing this documentation by extracting the docs into a browseable site.

## Initial setup

```shell
> pip install -r mkdocs-requirements.txt
```

## Running locally

```shell
> mkdocs serve
```

## Building the documentation site

```shell
> mkdocs build
```
