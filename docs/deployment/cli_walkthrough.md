# Getting Started

**The SIF Command Line Interface (sif-cli)** is an open-source tool that empowers you to interact with SIF components through commands in your command-line shell. With minimal configuration, `sif-cli` simplifies many of the complexities associated with managing SIF. Additionally, it incorporates various functionalities to ensure compatibility between your deployed version and the latest release of SIF.

> If you want to perform the deployment manually using cdk follow the instruction [here](./cdk_walkthrough.md).

To set up the CLI in `/usr/local/lib/sif` and `/usr/local/bin/sif`, run this script. The script requires sudo and isnâ€™t Windows compatible.

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-aws-sustainability-insights-framework/main/scripts/install-cli.sh | sh
```

## Prerequisites

### Tools

The following tools are required in order use `sif-cli`. Please reference each tool's documentation linked for full installation instructions.

| Tool / Technology                                                    | Reason                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) | Used by `sif-cli` to clone and switch version of SIF repository. |
| [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)                        | Used by `sif-cli` to build Java modules.                         |

### IAM Credentials

The command-line interface executes several AWS CDK commands (e.g., `cdk deploy`, `cdk destroy`) to deploy and remove AWS CloudFormation stacks in your target account. Please ensure that you have IAM credentials with the appropriate policies set up in your shell environment when running the scripts below.

### AWS Client VPN certificates

If you wish to enable AWS Client VPN during the deployment of platform shared components, please follow the steps outlined [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#mutual) to generate the  necessary certificates. Subsequently, upload these certificates to AWS Certificate Manager ([ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)).

After completing the deployment, you can establish a connection to the AWS Client VPN using either the AWS-provided client or the OpenVPN client, as specified [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/client-vpn-user-what-is.html).

**Note** A Client VPN connection is not allowed if using an existing VPC.

### RDS Concurrency Limit

When deploying SIF for a specific environment, the Aurora serverless cluster is shared among multiple tenants within that same environment. As a result, the actions of one tenant can potentially negatively impact the experience of another tenant within the system.

SIF employs concurrency control to regulate the number of simultaneous activities that can be executed against the database. The pipeline processors state machine performs a series of operations that can consume database resources. Before each of these operations, a `StepFunction` task must acquire a lock that is shared among multiple tenants within an environment before proceeding. The concurrency limit represents the number of available locks that can be leased by processes from various tenants.

The appropriate value for the RDS concurrency limit depends on your specific usage pattern. If your usage typically involves infrequent uploads of a few large files, it may be sensible to use a smaller number of locks. However, if SIF is used by multiple users across various locations to frequently upload a small number of files, it may be more practical to have a larger number of available locks.

Requests to "acquire" or "release" locks, which contain the stepFunction taskToken necessary for callback execution, are transmitted to an `SQS` (Simple Queue Service). The `acquireLock` Lambda function reads these requests from the queue, acquires the lock, and subsequently resumes the StepFunction execution.

To ensure smooth SIF deployments, it's essential to verify that the `acquireLockQueue` and `releaseLockQueue` are empty prior to deployment. This precaution helps prevent messages from being processed incorrectly.

### SIF, VPCs, and Using an Existing VPC

A SIF environment deploys resources into a VPC. Resources such as the Aurora cluster are deployed using subnets with no connectivity outside of the subnet (no NAT, no IGW) other than a VPC endpoint to S3. For the purposes of SIF these are called `isolated` subnets. Lambda functions which require access to the database are deployed attached to subnets in the VPC with no external connectivity other than VPC endpoints to multiple AWS services. For the purposes of SIF these are called `private` subnets.

A default deployment of SIF creates the VPC and subnets for you. You also have the option to use an exsiting VPC. This can be done during a platform deployment by specifying the VPC ID as well as the subnet IDs for the SIF `isolated` and SIF `private` subnets. An existing VPC must be configured with both `isolated` and `private` subnets. It is recommended to created at least 2 subnets of each type for high-availablity. The `isolated` subnet type should be configured with no external connectivity, meaning no NAT gateway, no internet gateway (IGW), and only a VPC endpoint connection to S3. The `private` subnets should be configured with no external connectivity except VPC endpoints for the following services:

* DYNAMODB
* S3
* KMS
* ATHENA
* CLOUDFORMATION
* EVENTBRIDGE
* SQS
* XRAY
* SECRETS_MANAGER
* ECS
* CLOUDWATCH_LOGS
* ECR
* ECR_DOCKER
* SSM
* RDS
* GLUE
* CLOUDWATCH
* LAMBDA
* STEP_FUNCTIONS

Take a look at how SIF creates a VPC in the [Network CDK construct](../../infrastructure/platform/src/shared/network.construct.ts) for a detailed example of the required configuration of an existing VPC.

## Installing

### 1. Initializing Your Development Environment

To initialize your current development environment with all the required software for SIF deployment, run the following command:

```shell
sif init
```

### 2. Clone SIF Repository

You can clone SIF from the GitHub repository into a folder named sif-core within the current folder where sif-cli is running by executing the following command:

```shell
sif core clone
```

```
USAGE
  $ sif core clone [-r <value>]

FLAGS
  -r, --repositoryUrl=<value>  Url of sif repository

DESCRIPTION
  Clone SIF into current folder

```


### 3. List SIF Release Versions

To list available SIF versions for deployment, run the following command. This list is retrieved from the SIF GitHub [releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).

```shell
sif core releases
```

```
USAGE
  $ sif core releases [--json]

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Listing the existing tags in the SIF repository

EXAMPLES
  $ sif core releases
```

By default, sif core clone should configure the latest version as your selected version. To check which SIF version is currently checked out, use the following command:

```shell
sif core version
```

```
USAGE
  $ sif core version [--json]

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Print the release tag currently checked out. If there is no release tag, show the branch and commit id

EXAMPLES

### 4. Build SIF Projects

Now that you have selected the version you want to deploy, run the following command to build SIF. This will build all the modules in the SIF monorepo:

```shell
sif core build
```
```
USAGE
  $ sif core build

DESCRIPTION
  Performs incremental build of all SIF modules

EXAMPLES
  $ sif core build
```


### 5. Deploying SIF Environment

To start the environment deployment process, execute the following command. In this example, we specify `demo` as the name of the environment. `sif-cli` will guide you through a list of configurable settings that you can apply to your SIF environment deployment:

```shell
sif environment install -e demo
```
```
USAGE
  $ sif environment install -e <value> [-r <value>] [--json] [-h -c <value>]

FLAGS
  -c, --config=<value>       Path to configuration file used for environment upgrade
  -e, --environment=<value>  (required) An environment represents an isolated deployment of tenantId(s)
  -h, --headless             Perform SIF environment upgrade in headless mode, if specified you also need to specify the
                             configuration file
  -r, --region=<value>       AWS region used when running the subcommands

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Install SIF for the specified environment

EXAMPLES
  $ sif environment install -e stage

  $ sif environment install -e stage -h -c <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>
```


You can then list the deployed environments by running the following command, which should include `demo` as one of the deployed environments:

```shell
sif environment list
```
```
USAGE
  $ sif environment list [-r <value>] [--json]

FLAGS
  -r, --region=<value>  AWS region used when running the subcommands

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
