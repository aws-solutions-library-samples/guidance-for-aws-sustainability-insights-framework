# Items added to this file will be ignored by Semgrep.
#
# This file uses .gitignore syntax:
#
# Some parts of .gitignore syntax are not supported, and patterns
# using this syntax will be dropped from the ignore list:
# - Explicit "include syntax", e.g. "!kept/".
# - Multi-character expansion syntax, e.g. "*.py[cod]"
#
# To include ignore patterns from another file, start a line
# with ':include', followed by the path of the file. E.g.
# ":include path/to/other/ignore/file".
#
# To ignore a file with a literal ':' character, escape it with
# a backslash, e.g. "\:foo".
